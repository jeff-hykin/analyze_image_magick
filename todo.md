- 10 Vulnerabilities

- include vulnerabilities from at least 3 of the following categories:
  1. Spatial Memory Attacks: Out-of-bound access, buffer/stack/heap overflow
  2. Temporal Memory Attacks: Use-after-free, double-free
  3. Control Flow Attacks: Control-flow hijacking, arbitrarycodeexecution,return-oriented programming
  4. ConcurrencyAttacks: Race conditions, data dependency attacks, time-to-check-to-time-to-use
  5. APIattack: Privilege escalation, semantic check bypass, permission violation

- why do you think this is a vulerability
- try to estimate the score
  - maturity (proof of concept, functional, in use)
  - remediation level (temp fix/no fix)
  - report confidence (confirmed/unknown)
