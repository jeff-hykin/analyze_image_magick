FINAL RESULTS:

codebase/MagickCore/utility.c:1022:  [5] (race) readlink:
    This accepts filename arguments; if an attacker can move those files or
    change the link content, a race condition results. Also, it does not
    terminate with ASCII NUL. (CWE-362, CWE-20). Reconsider approach.

Not every hit is necessarily a security vulnerability.
You can inhibit a report by adding a comment in this form:
// flawfinder: ignore
Make *sure* it's a false positive!
You can use the option --neverignore to show these.

There may be other security vulnerabilities; review your code!
